## Activities

Here are some of the activities we will be looking at today!

-  [Shark game in Scratch](#scratch-shark-game)
-  [Bird website in HTML](#html-bird-website)
-  [Other options](#other-activities)

## Session Guidelines

1. Have fun!
1. Be nice to each other (I'm sure you will be).
1. Coding is 50% writing code, 50% Googling the answer! If you don't know how to do something, try reading the instructions, looking at the provided resources, or putting your question into a search engine.
1. Help each other out! Some of you will know more than each other, and that's okay. Helping others will help you understand code better, even if it's something you think is easy.
1. Don't be afraid to ask for help if you're stuck!
1. If you want to play any music or sounds from your computer, please use headphones if they are available.
1. If you need help or want to work on something different, just let me know and we'll sort it out.

## What is code?

Code is a set of instructions we give to a computer to make it do something.

Coding languages, or programming languages, are languages that have been made so we can more easily give complex instructions to computers.

You can code almost anything if you try hard enough! Toasters, clothing, sports matches (though that would require a very expensive robotics budget)...

At PowerhouseCoders we can learn and/or make:

-  computer languages
   -  JavaScript
   -  Python
   -  C, C++, C# and more
   -  HTML
   -  CSS
-  websites, software and apps
-  games
   -  Scratch
   -  Unity
   -  Twine
-  electronics
   -  Micro:bit
   -  Raspberry Pi
   -  Arduino
   -  wearable tech
   -  robots
-  music
   -  SonicPi
   -  MakeyMakey

## Scratch Shark Game

Try out using Scratch by making a keyboard game where you play a shark looking for its next meal.

> Used Scratch before? Follow the instructions to make it and then see if you can make something even better afterwards!

### Instructions

[Instructions are here!](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/cd-beginner-scratch-sushi/0)

## HTML Bird Website

Learn HTML by making a website about birds. Once you've learned HTML, you can make almost any website you can imagine!

### Instructions

[Click here for your instructions!](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/cd-sebento-htmlcss-1)

There is a bit more information on HTML and CSS [here](/sessions/001), in last session's notes.

If you finish part 1, try out [part 2](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/cd-sebento-htmlcss-2) and [part 3](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/cd-sebento-htmlcss-3).

## Other Activities

-  Use Twine to make a choose-your-own-adventure game
-  MakeyMakey (only one at a time!)

### Twine

Twine is software you can use to make choose-your-own-adventure style text games.

Each option is a 'passage' that has a number of options that lead to other passages. These can lead to multiple endings - good or bad, up to you!

### MakeyMakey

You can use a MakeyMakey circuit board to make your own computer buttons out of everyday objects - such as coins, keys and even bananas!

This consists of two parts.

1. Setting up a circuit between the everyday object and the MakeyMakey board.
2. Adding code to a programme so that a certain sound is played when your object is pressed. You'll be using [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu)!

There are some learning resources [here](https://makeymakey.com/pages/how-to).
