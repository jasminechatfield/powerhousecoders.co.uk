# Saturday 9th October 2021

Here are the guidelines and resources for our first session in case you miss or forget anything!

This one will be fairly simple, but please do give me your suggestions for next time. :)

We'll be covering:

-  HTML/CSS
-  Javascript
-  Scratch
-  MakeyMakey
-  circuits

^ If you'd rather do something else in the session, let me know and we can hopefully get it set up.

## Session Guidelines

1. Have fun!
1. Be nice to each other (I'm sure you will be).
1. Coding is 50% writing code, 50% Googling the answer! If you don't know how to do something, try reading the instructions, looking at the provided resources, or putting your question into a search engine. If you've had a look, and you're still stuck, ask for some help.
1. Help each other out! Some of you will know more than each other, and that's okay. Helping others will help you understand code better, even if it's something you think is easy.
1. Don't be afraid to ask for help!
1. If you want to play any music or sounds from your computer, please use headphones if they are available. Otherwise make sure to keep it as quiet as you can so we can all hear each other.
1. If you need help or want to work on something different, just let me know and we'll sort it out.

## What is code?

Code is a set of instructions we give to a computer to make it do something.

Coding languages, or programming languages, are languages that have been made so we can more easily give complex instructions to computers.

You can code almost anything if you try hard enough! Toasters, clothing, sports matches (though that would require a very expensive robotics budget)...

At PowerhouseCoders we can learn and/or make:

-  computer languages
   -  JavaScript
   -  Python
   -  C, C++, C# and more
   -  HTML
   -  CSS
-  websites, software and apps
-  games
   -  Scratch
   -  Unity
   -  Twine
-  electronics
   -  Micro:bit
   -  Raspberry Pi
   -  Arduino
   -  wearable tech
   -  robots
-  music
   -  SonicPi
   -  MakeyMakey

## HTML, CSS and JS

That's a lot of acronyms! But with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, you can make almost any part of any website you've seen.

HTML and CSS has come a long way since I was first making websites, back in the late 1990s / early 2000s...

Examples of old sites

Nowadays it's much easier to make a site look nice!

This is because these computer languages are always evolving - they are being added to all the time.

### What's the difference?

**HTML** creates each element that you can see on a website - e.g. a title, a paragraph, an image.

**CSS** is used to add _styling_ to those elements - e.g. background colour, text size, layouts.

**JavaScript** is used to create additional _functionality_ for webpages - e.g. when you click a picture in a gallery, it gets bigger or smaller.

### What do I need to know?

You can make a basic website with only HTML and CSS. You don't even need CSS if you don't mind how it looks!

This is what the PowerhouseCoders homepage looks like without CSS...

<img src="/assets/images/001/withoutcss.png" />

...not pretty, but at least all the information is there!

> Compare the no-CSS homepage to the [real homepage]("/") - can you see all of the differences? What about the similarities?

Here's some HTML:

```
<h1>PowerhouseCoders</h1>
<p>This is my sick new site for PowerhouseCoders, a
new code club at Moss Side Powerhouse Library.</p>
```

And here's some CSS:

```
body {
  background-color: pink;
  font-family: Courier, monospace;
}

h1 {
  background-color: black;
  color: pink;
}

p {
  background-color: #ff6699;
}
```

Together, they make:

<img src="/assets/images/001/htmlcssdemo.png"/>

If I add a few lines of JavaScript:

```
document.addEventListener("click", () => {
  document.body.style["background-color"] = "black";
})
```

When you click anywhere, the background colour changes to black.

<img src="/assets/images/001/withjs.png"/>

Dark mode!

You don't need to understand all of this to be able to make a website, but it helps to know why we use 3 different languages (HTML, CSS, JS) to make websites.

[Play around with my code here at Codepen.io](https://codepen.io/powerhousecoders/pen/abyorVj).

### Your mission...

...is to make a website. Too simple? Well, you can make it as difficult as you want!

1. Choose a topic for your site. This can be anything you want! A hobby, favourite celebrity, favourite animal. You could even make a website about coding if you wanted.
2. Plan your site.
3. Start building! You can use Trinket - [here's a link to my template](https://trinket.io/html/6106f164d7?showInstructions=true).
4. You can sign up for a free Trinket account to save your work. You can use it without an account, just make sure you don't close the tab, and that you 'share' your work by email to me before you quit!
5. If you want to work on your website more later, make sure to save the code. Ask for help if you don't know how!
6. Email your code to [powerhouse_manchester.uk@coderdojo.com]("mailto:powerhouse_manchester.uk@coderdojo.com") so I can have a look.
7. I can publish your site online if you want!

> Remember, coding languages use the American spelling of 'colour', which is 'color'... so colour -> color (confusing, I know)

### HTML Checklist

#### Basic

-  add a title
-  add a paragraph
-  add a picture
-  embed a video
-  add a bullet-point list
-  add a numbered list
-  add a link to another website

#### Advanced

-  group related elements together into <div> elements
-  add classes and IDs
-  make multiple pages that link to each other

#### Very advanced

-  draw an SVG shape

#### Verrrrrry advanced

-  help me update the PowerhouseCoders website!

### CSS Checklist

#### Basic

-  add a background colour
-  change the text font
-  change the text colour (make sure its readable!)
-  give something a border

#### Advanced

-  use hex codes for your colours
-  give your headings and your normal text different fonts and styles
-  change the background colour of individual elements on the page
-  add margins and/or padding to individual elements on the page
-  give an element a :hover state

#### Very advanced

-  create a mobile layout for your site using media queries
-  make your header 'sticky'
-  give an element its own scroll bar
-  use CSS grid or flexbox to create a layout
-  use CSS transitions to animate your :hover states

### Safety

-  Do not put any identifying information or contact information on your page. A first name is ok. An email address, last name, or address is a no - unless you have a parent or guardian's permission (even then, don't put your address).

### Glossary

-  HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language
-  CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
-  JS is short for JavaScript, a programming language
-  a font is a specific style of text. Arial, Times New Roman, Helvetica - these are all font typefaces
-  margins are the spacing between elements on a page - like a forcefield that repels other elements away
-  padding is how much space an element has around it - like bubblewrap in a parcel
-  CSS grid or flexbox are ways to lay out a webpage so that it can change depending on the size of the browser window

## MakeyMakey

We'll be using a MakeyMakey board to make our own computer buttons out of everyday objects - such as coins, keys and even bananas!

This consists of two parts.

1. Setting up a circuit between the everyday object and the MakeyMakey board.
2. Adding code to a programme so that a certain sound is played when your object is pressed. We'll be using [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu)!

I'll guide you through this, so don't worry!

### Resources

-  [MakeyMakey site resources](https://makeymakey.com/pages/how-to)

### Safety

The MakeyMakey board is safe because it only uses a very low, harmless level of electricity.

However it is important you **do not attach it to anything electronic or battery-powered** as it could cause damage to the MakeyMakey, your electronic device, or (in extreme cases) you.

## Next time

We can do some robotics with the Micro:bit or Raspberry Pi, look at some Python, or anything else you're interested in!

If you've already got a project in mind, let me know today or in the next session.
